To install the Xlrd package in 1and1 hosting:

1. Download easy_install
2. Install easy_install
3. run command

```easy_install --root```

4. include the library directly on the script
5. using PYTHONPATH will not work since the apache server running the cgi is under control of 1and1 admin and does not export PYTHONPATH from the local environment of a user account
