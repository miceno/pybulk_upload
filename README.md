To install the Xlrd package in 1and1 hosting:
# Download easy_install
# Install easy_install
   
# run command
 easy_install --root
# include the library directly on the script
# using PYTHONPATH will not work since the apache server running the cgi is under control of 1and1 admin and does not export PYTHONPATH from the local environment of a user account
